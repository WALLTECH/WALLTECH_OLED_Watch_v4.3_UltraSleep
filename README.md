WALLTECH OLED Watch v4.3 UltraSleep
===================================

This is the source code for the latest prototype of my Arduino OLED wristwatch. v4.3 now has a MCP9808 temperature sensor and interrupt connections to enable deep sleep mode which could allow >2 months on battery!

Required libraries are in the libraries folder. To use them, drop the folder's contents into your Arduino IDE's "LIBRARIES" folder in documents. If there isn't one, create one.
