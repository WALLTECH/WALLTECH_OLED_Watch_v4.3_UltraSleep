WALLTECH OLED Watch v4.3 UltraSleep
===================================

This is the repository for the hardware files and source code of the latest prototype of the WΛLLTΞCH OLED wristwatch. v4.3 now has a MCP9808 temperature sensor and interrupt connections to enable an ultra deep sleep mode that allows 3 weeks on the watch's 300mAh LiPo battery instead of the previous version's 2 days!

Required Arduino IDE libraries are in the "libraries" folder. To use them, drop the folder's contents into your Arduino IDE's "LIBRARIES" folder in documents. If there isn't one, create one. To create a watch circuit board, submit the "Gerber" .zip file to the online PCB manufacturer of your choice, or if you're feeling brave, etch and drill a board yourself!
